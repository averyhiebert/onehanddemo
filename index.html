  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <div style="text-align:left;max-width:600px">
  <p>
  When Caps lock is off, type normally.
  </p>
  <p>
  When Caps Lock is on, type with your left hand as though it was your
  right hand (see <a href="https://blog.xkcd.com/2007/08/14/mirrorboard-a-one-handed-keyboard-layout-for-the-lazy/">Randall Munroe's blog post</a>, my 
  original inspiration, for an explanation of the concept).  
  The webapp will try to guess which keys you intended without
  you needing to specify.
  Use <em>shift+space</em> for a newline, and <em>`</em> (backtick) to backspace.
  <p>
  <p> When in Caps Lock mode you can only enter &amp; delete text
  at the end of the text.  Sorry.
  <p>
  <p>
  Note that currently I map a to ;, not ' as Randall does, but I will be
  adding support for alternate layouts in the future.

  Note also that my mapping (and Randall's) differs slightly from another
  commonly taught finger layout for touch typing (as described by the
  creator of similar product One Hand Keyboard 
  <a href="http://www.onehandkeyboard.org/standard-qwerty-finger-placement/">here</a>).
